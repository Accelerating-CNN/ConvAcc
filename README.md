# This project is a part of the practical course, which is "Accelerating Convolutional Neural Networks using Programmable Logic" at TUM.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a domain of research that already has disrupted many parts of our digital lives. To improve the energy-efficiency and performance of AI algorithms dedicated hardware becomes more and more important and while the industry already offers some solutions there is a lack of education at German universities.

Today, a lot of AI classification is performed on the cloud, which allows big companies access to private data of end users. A focus on designing dedicated AI accelerators for end-user devices (on the "edge") could increase data security and privacy.

This project aims at bringing multiple teams from TUM and Uni Potsdam together to offer hybrid practical courses regarding the development of dedicated AI chips. The project has access to the unique opportunity for students to fabricate their own AI-chips due to the Partnership with Leibniz Institute for High Performance Microelectronics (IHP)
